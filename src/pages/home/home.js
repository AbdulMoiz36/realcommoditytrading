          Our Partners have the opportunity to earn up to U$10,000 in credit*
          for each verified seller, buyer, or financier registration they
          complete. All associated documents, such as Previous Records, Proof of
          Products or Funds, Letter of Intent (LOI), Soft Corporate Offer (SCO)
          must also be included for verification purposes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our dedicated Partners also have options to work closely with shipping
          agents responsible for export/import processes and are involved in
          essential loading/unloading activities via an established inspection
          agency. Service fee will be paid to our partners once the work is
          finished.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          * Our partner earns more than just commission when the involved
          transaction is completed. Rewarded credit is also cashed out with some
          restrictions. Make sure you take advantage of every opportunity with
          us and get rewarded today. Find more at{" "}

    content: (
      <>
        <p>
          Verified offers are only created by our company after a detailed
          verification process, which confirms the authenticity of the offer
          through Previous Record(s), Proofs of Product(s) or Fund(s). This
          helps protect our members from receiving fake offers/services or
          fraudulent payments. When transactions complete successfully in this
          section, there is also an associated service fee charged by us.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Offers created by our member on the other hand do not require proof
          for authentication and therefore no service fee will be incurred when
          listed at our websites.

          To ensure the efficient completion of verified offer posts, a service
          fee will be charged for each successful transaction. For transactions
          up to USD10 million, service fee is 3%, then 2% for those between
          USD10M-50M; 1% for trades between USD50M-100M; and just 0.5 % above
          USD100M. Don't be shy about discussing rates: negotiations are always
